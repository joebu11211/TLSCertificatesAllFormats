2. OpenSSL

# Usage Example
./certificates.sh $Key $ServerCertifciate $IntermediateRootCertifciate $AppName $StorePass $RSAPASS

$Key = path to key file
$ServerCertificate = path to PEM server certficate (stand alone so only one cert in the file)
$IntermediateRootCertificate = path to PEM intermediate/root certificate where all needed certificates would reside
